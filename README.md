# smart_neckband_for_deaf_drivers

📖 Project Overview
The Smart Neckband for Deaf Drivers is an innovative wearable system designed to improve road safety for individuals with hearing impairments. It detects vehicle horn sounds, identifies their direction, and provides immediate haptic feedback through vibration motors positioned around the neck.

🛠️ How It Works
🎤 Sound Capture:
Three directional microphones (left, center, right) continuously capture environmental sounds.

🧠 Processing:
An Arduino Nano microcontroller processes sound signals, isolates horn frequencies, and determines the direction based on intensity differences.

📳 Vibration Feedback:
Based on the detected direction, the corresponding motor (left, center, or right) vibrates to alert the user.

🎯 Ambient Noise Calibration:
The system dynamically adjusts its sensitivity to filter background noise and prevent false alerts.

🔋 Wearable Design:
Lightweight, rechargeable, and comfortable for continuous use in real-world driving scenarios.

🌟 Why It Matters
Bridges sensory gaps by converting critical auditory signals into tactile alerts.

Enhances reaction time, situational awareness, and road safety for deaf drivers.

Offers a cost-effective, scalable solution without modifying the vehicle itself.

Sets the stage for future upgrades like Bluetooth connectivity, mobile app integration, and AI-based sound classification.

🔮 Future Scope
📱 Bluetooth integration for mobile app notifications.

🧠 AI-based real-time sound classification.

📡 GPS integration for location-based hazard alerts.

🎨 Enhanced ergonomic and aesthetic designs.

🚀 Conclusion
The Smart Neckband transforms traditional driving experiences for deaf individuals, making roads safer, navigation more intuitive, and mobility more independent — one vibration at a time.
